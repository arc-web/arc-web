## 👋 About Me

I help businesses find the "why" behind their advertising ROI. With over 20 years in paid marketing and 4 business acquisitions, I've built systems that actually work - not just demos, but production-grade automation that saves hours every day.

Based in Miami, Florida, I run Advertising Report Card while developing AI automation tools and custom integrations for agencies and businesses.
